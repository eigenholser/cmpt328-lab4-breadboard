Lab 4 - Breadboard
==================

This lab project was developed for the Westminster College Spring 2015 CMPT328
Computer Architecture course.

This was developed using the IAR Systems Embedded Workbench. Some slight
modifications will be necessary for Keil uVision or Code Composer.

Implements primitive UI using ``SW1``, ``SW2``, and the LEDs. Various GPIO
pins are used to output digital signals to the breadboard. All of this is
described in the Lab 4 Exercise document.
